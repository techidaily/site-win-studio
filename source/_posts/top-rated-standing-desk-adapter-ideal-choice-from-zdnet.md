## How did we choose these standing desk converters?

There are literally hundreds of standing desk converters on the market, and the number of options has only increased since the pandemic began and more people started working from home. So you might be wondering -- how did we narrow our list down to just seven?

Here are a few qualities we looked for when choosing the best standing desk converters:

* **Usability:** It's important that a standing desk converter be easy enough for anyone to raise and lower it. We considered how difficult it is to use the desk and specifically looked for those that were accessible to most people.
* **Stability:** The last thing you want is a standing desk converter that feels that it may fall down at any moment. While some products on our list provide more stability than others, we only considered those that provide at least decent stability.
* **Price:** With so many affordable options on the market, there's no reason to spend a fortune on your standing desk converter. While some of the products on our list are more affordable than others, we think each one provides plenty of value for the price.
* **Workspace:** We know just how important it is to have all the space you need in your workspace. We looked for standing desk converters that offered customers plenty of workspaces, including those with two-tier workspaces or large single-tier workspaces.
* **Assembly:** We specifically looked for standing desk converters that either come pre-assembled or are easy to assemble. While many of the options on our list do require assembly, customer reviews repeatedly point to how easy they are to assemble.

## Which is the right one for you?

Are you looking for a standing desk converter for your workspace? There are seven excellent options on our list, and each one is best for a certain type of user.

When choosing a standing desk converter, the first thing to consider is what exactly you need it for. Someone who wants a workspace for their laptop and dual monitors will need a very different product than someone who only wants a stand for their laptop. 

It's also important to consider your budget. We've included standing desk converters at various price points. Whether you can afford to splurge or are on a limited budget, you'll be able to find a product for you, but your budget will certainly impact your options.

Next, ask yourself if you have any difficulty lifting things. While most of the standing desk converters on our list are relatively easy to list, someone who really struggles to lift things will likely prefer a motorized standing desk converter. On the other hand, someone who has no problem lifting may prioritize other features.

The good news is that we've specifically built our list so that every type of customer can find the best standing desk converter for them, no matter what they need.

## How can I turn my desk into a standing desk?

Many people have chosen to [purchase standing desks](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-standing-desks/) for their workspaces. But if you'd rather not buy an entirely new desk, you can purchase a standing desk converter to place on your desk.

## How much does a standing desk converter cost?

## What is the best standing desk converter?

There's not necessarily one best standing desk converter for everyone. To choose the best option for you, it's important to consider your budget, how much of a workspace you need, and how easily you can lift things.
