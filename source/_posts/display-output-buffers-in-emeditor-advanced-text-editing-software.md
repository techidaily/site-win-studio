Some of our perl scripts output a lot of data, and the top gets lost after 838 lines.  
 Is there a way to increase the output buffer size? We could output to a file, too, but that would seriously hamper our editing efficiency, not having the output in the output bar to work from.  
 Thanks!

 I will increase the buffer size for the next major version. Thanks!

Perhaps a better alternative would be to pump it to a temporary data file and then edit that file rather than keeping an internal buffer.  
 ….just my 2cents worth….which with today’s gas prices is worth about 0.2cents! :-o

We can do that now (and have to in the case of the lost output) but would much rather it all stay in the output bar.  
 Perhaps, if the buffer size is going to be increased, maybe there could be a buffer dump to file in the current directory if the threshold is reached. A bonus option would be to have the buffer size editable and/or the dump an on/off option (which would be necessary if it had any effect on performance).  
 Thanks!
