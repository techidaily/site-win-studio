So I think the above top 5 ones will not let you down if you try them. Another feedback is that they want to download some of the courses but do not know how when users use the above top 5 online learning websites.

Actually, among Udemy, the top 5 online learning websites, and other online learning websites, few of them support online course download and some of them only support their subscribers to download their courses for offline playback on their Apps. **If users want to download any online learning course for offline playback without limitation, they should try a [professional online course downloader - Allavsoft](https://tools.techidaily.com/allavsoft/products/).
