## About Norton Ghost

Norton Ghost is one **disk imaging and cloning tool** that firstly developed in the 1990s.

### Image Your Computer with Norton Ghost

2\. On the Home screen, you can create a backup task by clicking **Define Backup Wizard** or **Run or Manage Backups**. Here we choose the latter one.

[![Create Backup](https://www.ubackup.com/articles/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/others/norton-ghost/create-backup.png)
